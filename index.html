                    artisan support, 65-35, after Democrats removed a proposal to raise the country’s debt ceiling. The 
                    bill will maintain federal agencies' spending, provide $28.6 billion to communities that are rebuil

                    Coverage was prominent across the political spectrum. Some left-rated outlets highlighted the Repub
                    licans who voted agaist it; some center- and right-rated outlets framed the Senate and Hosue votes 
                    as bipartisan. Left-rated voices remained critical of Senate Republicans who are "refusing to give 
                    the majority party any of the votes needed to move ahead on a bill to avert a first-ever federal de
                    fault." Right-rated outlets were more likely to emphasize how Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
                     (R-Ky.) "applauded the clean legislation," but doubled down on his claim that "Republicans will not
                      assist Democrats in raising the debt ceiling." Updated at 10:08pm ET 9/30/21 with news of Biden's

                    Watch Kate Middleton’s incredible forehand- doubles with Emma!
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Royal tennis fan Kate Middleton and British champion Emma Raducanu came face to face on Friday morn
                    ing. Kate and 2021 U.S. Open women’s singles winner Raducanu chatted at the National Tennis Centre 
                    in southwest London before pairing up for a quick doubles game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Raducanu — who shot to fame at Wimbledon and then surprised the tennis world by being the first wom
                    an to enter via the qualifying rounds and progress all the way to the pinnacle of the sport at the 
                    U.S. Open in New York earlier this month — was among a group of young tennis stars including Joe Sa
                    lisbury, Alfie Hewitt and Gordon Reid who were celebrated by Kate.

                <p>
                    After a chat, the group took to the court, with the duchess showing off her skills. And Raducanu, 
                    18, was impressed with her royal partner, telling reporters “her forehand is incredible.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as the homecoming celebration, Kate, who is patron of the Lawn Tennis Association, also met
                     teenagers from around the U.K. The young athletes are playing tennis at a grassroots level as part 
                     of the LTA Youth program, which aims to encourage participation in the sport and inspire the next 
                     generation of players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program’s goal is to help more children enjoy the benefits of playing and staying in tennis, 
                    regardless of age, gender, ability, disability or background. Read more...

                    432 Park  Ave. is one of Manhattan’s most exclusive residences. The developers are facing a $250 
                    million lawsuit over building defects. Faulty elevators, flooding and intolerable noises are just
                    some of the problems residents complain about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, the occupants of 432 Park Avenue are suing its developers for failing to address some 1,500
                    alleged defects.
                    The lawsuit claims that the building’s problems have “endangered and inconvenienced” residents and
                    guests.
